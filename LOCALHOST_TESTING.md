## ‚ùå What DOESN'T Work on Localhost (Needs Setup)

### **Auto-Create Method** - Needs OAuth Setup

**Error you'll see:**

```
Failed to create meeting via API: Error: Invalid access token
```

**Why?**

- Needs ZOOM_CLIENT_ID in `.env`
- Needs ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET in `.env`
- Teacher needs to connect Zoom account
- Requires OAuth setup (see SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**To fix:**

1. Follow `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Part 1 (Admin Setup)
2. Add credentials to `.env`
3. Restart dev server
4. Teacher connects Zoom
5. Then test auto-create

### **Event Subscriptions (Webhooks)** - Won't Work on Localhost

**Error you'll see:**

```
URL validation failed
```

**Why?**

- Zoom can't reach localhost
- Needs public URL (https://yourdomain.com)
- Only works after deployment

**What this means:**

- Duration tracking won't work
- Meeting started/ended events won't fire
- Everything else works fine!
