### Step 5: Configure Event Subscriptions (For Duration Tracking)

**This step enables automatic meeting duration tracking**

1. Click **"Feature"** tab (left sidebar)

2. Find **"Event Subscriptions"** section

3. Toggle **"Enable Event Subscription"** to ON

4. **Event notification endpoint URL:**

   ```
   https://darulkubra.com/api/zoom/webhooks
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**

   - Replace `darulkubra.com` with YOUR actual domain
   - Must be **HTTPS** (not HTTP)
   - Must be publicly accessible
   - For **localhost testing**: Skip this step (duration tracking won't work locally, but manual links still work!)

5. Click **"Validate"** button

   - Zoom will send test request to your URL
   - Should show ‚úÖ green checkmark if successful

   **‚ùå VALIDATION FAILED? READ THIS:**

   **Quick Test:** Open browser and go to your webhook URL:

   ```
   https://exam.darelkubra.com/api/zoom/webhooks
   ```

   - ‚ùå URL wrong ‚Üí check domain name
   - ‚ùå Not deployed yet ‚Üí webhooks need production server

   - Add webhooks later when server ready
   - Manual links work perfectly

### Teacher's Job (Optional):

```
Teacher ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Click "Connect" ‚Üí Allow ‚Üí Auto-create available
```

**Result:** This teacher can now auto-create meetings

## ‚úÖ QUICK START FOR YOU

**Right now, you can:**

1. **Skip OAuth entirely** - Manual method works!
2. **Or do OAuth setup** - Follow Part 1 above (30 min)

**For video:**

- Show manual method first (works now)
- Show OAuth setup (optional enhancement)
- Show teacher connecting (if OAuth done)

---

## üìä WHAT YOU SEE AFTER SETUP

### If OAuth NOT configured:

- Teachers see "Connect Zoom" banner
- Auto-create section shows "Not Available"
- Manual method always visible
- ‚úÖ Everything works!

### If OAuth IS configured:

- Teachers can connect
- After connecting: Auto-create available
- Manual method still works
- ‚úÖ Both methods work!

---

## üéØ MY RECOMMENDATION

**Start simple:**

1. Deploy system now
2. Teachers use manual method
3. See if they want auto-create
4. If yes, do OAuth setup
5. Roll out gradually

**Why?**

- Manual works immediately
- No confusion
- Test system first
- Add OAuth when ready

---

## üí° THE KEY DIFFERENCE

### **ADMIN SETUP** (Part 1):

- Creates the "bridge" between your system and Zoom
- Uses ONE Zoom account for configuration
- Done ONCE for entire organization
- Enables auto-create features

### **TEACHER USAGE** (Part 2):

- Each teacher can optionally connect THEIR Zoom
- OR just use manual method
- No setup required to use manual
- Personal choice per teacher

---

## üé¨ FOR YOUR VIDEO

**Show this order:**

### Part 1: "Works Right Now" (2 min)

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Webhook Validation Failed?

**Problem:** When adding webhook URL, Zoom says "Validation failed"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check URL is correct:**

   - Must be: `https://darulkubra.com/api/zoom/webhooks`
   - Replace `darulkubra.com` with YOUR domain
   - Must start with `https://` (not `http://`)

2. **Check server is running:**

   - Your application must be running
   - Endpoint must be publicly accessible
   - Test by visiting: `https://darulkubra.com/api/zoom/webhooks`

3. **For localhost testing:**
   - Webhooks won't work on localhost
   - Skip Event Subscriptions step
   - Manual links will still work
   - Duration tracking won't work until deployed

### "Invalid Client" Error?

**Check:** `.env` file credentials are exactly as copied (no extra spaces)

### Teachers Can't See "Connect Zoom"?

**Check:**

1. OAuth setup completed by admin
2. `.env` has all credentials
3. Server restarted after adding credentials

### Auto-Create Button Not Showing?

**Check:**

1. Admin completed OAuth setup
2. Teacher has connected their Zoom account
3. Hard refresh page (Ctrl + Shift + R)

### Duration Not Tracking?

**Check:**

1. Event Subscriptions configured in Zoom
2. Webhook URL is validated (green checkmark)
3. Meeting was created via auto-create (not manual)
4. Application is deployed (not localhost)
