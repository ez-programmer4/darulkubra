# Debug Guide: MUBAREK RAHMETO - Akram Khalid Issue

## Overview

This document explains the enhanced debug logging added to troubleshoot why student "Akram Khalid" is not appearing in the student breakdown for teacher "MUBAREK RAHMETO".

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging in `salary-calculator.ts`

The following debug points have been added:

#### A. Teacher Detection

- Teachers with names containing "mubarek" or "rahmeto" will trigger detailed debug logging
- Students with names containing "akram" or "khalid" will also trigger enhanced logging

#### B. Debug Points

**1. Initial Students Fetch (Line 155-179)**

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ 🔍 ENHANCED DEBUG - Teacher Salary Calculation Start
```

- Shows total students found for the teacher
- Lists all students with their:
  - Package
  - Day Package
  - Status
  - Zoom Links count
  - Occupied Times count
  - Individual zoom link dates

**2. Akram Khalid Specific Check (Line 853-876)**

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ 🔍 SPECIAL DEBUG - AKRAM KHALID CHECK
```

- Searches entire database for any student with "akram" or "khalid" in name
- Shows for each match:
  - Current assigned teacher
  - Package and Day Package
  - Status
  - All occupied times with dates
  - All zoom links in the period

**3. Students Found Summary (Line 878-917)**

```
📊 DEBUG - Students Found Summary:
```

- Total students found (current + historical + zoom-based)
- Breakdown of where students came from
- Complete zoom links breakdown with timestamps

**4. Student Processing Debug (Line 1033-1407)**

```
🔍 DEBUG - Teacher Periods for [Student Name]
```

For Akram Khalid specifically:

- Teacher periods found
- Zoom links with dates
- Expected teaching days
- Actual teaching days counted
- Earnings calculation step-by-step

**5. Final Debug Summary (Line 1525-1560)**

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ 🔍 FINAL DEBUG SUMMARY - BASE SALARY CALCULATION
```

- Total students processed vs. in breakdown
- Each student's inclusion status
- **Students NOT in breakdown** with reasons

## How to View Debug Logs

### Step 1: Navigate to Teacher Payments Page

1. Go to Admin Panel
2. Navigate to "Teacher Payments"
3. Select the month you want to investigate

### Step 2: Check Server Console/Logs

The debug information is logged to the server console. Check:

**For Development:**

```bash
# Look at the terminal where your dev server is running
# You'll see detailed logs with box-drawing characters
```

**For Production:**

```bash
# Check your server logs
# Logs will appear when the page loads teacher payment data
```

### Step 3: Refresh the Page

1. Go to: `/admin/teacher-payments?clearCache=true`
2. This forces a fresh calculation with debug logging

### Step 4: Search for Specific Student

In the console logs, search for:

- "AKRAM KHALID CHECK" - Shows if student exists in database
- "Student: akram" or "Student: khalid" - Shows student details
- "STUDENTS NOT IN BREAKDOWN" - Shows why excluded

## Common Issues to Look For

### Issue 1: Student Not Found at All

**Look for:** Empty result in "AKRAM KHALID CHECK"
**Means:** Student doesn't exist in database with that name
**Check:**

- Correct spelling of name
- Student ID
- Database entry exists

### Issue 2: Student Found but Not Assigned to Teacher

**Look for:** Student in "AKRAM KHALID CHECK" but different teacher in `ustaz` field
**Means:** Student is assigned to different teacher
**Check:**

- `occupied_times` table for teacher assignments
- Teacher change history
- Assignment dates overlap with selected period

### Issue 3: Student Assigned but No Zoom Links

**Look for:** Student has occupied_times but `Zoom Links: 0`
**Means:** No zoom links sent during the period
**Check:**

- `zoom_links` table for this student
- Date range of zoom links
- Teacher who sent the links

### Issue 4: Student Has Zoom Links but No Package

**Look for:** `Package: NOT SET` in debug output
**Means:** Package not configured, so daily rate = 0
**Check:**

- Student's package field in database
- Package salary configuration
- Make sure package name matches exactly

### Issue 5: Student Has Everything but Wrong Day Package

**Look for:** `Expected teaching days: 0` or mismatch with zoom link dates
**Means:** Daypackage doesn't match actual teaching days
**Check:**

- Student's `daypackages` field
- Occupied times `daypackage` field
- Should be "MWF", "TTS", or "All days"

### Issue 6: Student Excluded Due to Teacher Change

**Look for:** `Not processed in calculateBaseSalary - check assignment periods`
**Means:** Teacher period doesn't overlap with selected month
**Check:**

- `teacher_change_history` table
- `occupied_times` start and end dates
- When teacher was assigned vs. when they were teaching

## What to Report

When you see the debug logs, note:

1. **Is Akram Khalid found in database?**

   - Yes/No
   - If yes, what's the student ID?

2. **Who is the current teacher assigned?**

   - From `ustaz` field
   - From `occupied_times` entries

3. **Are there zoom links in the period?**

   - How many?
   - What dates?
   - Which teacher sent them?

4. **What's the package and daypackage?**

   - Package name
   - Day package value
   - Are they set?

5. **Is the student in "STUDENTS NOT IN BREAKDOWN"?**

   - If yes, what's the reason shown?

6. **What's the student's status?**
   - Active, Not yet, or other?

## Debug Log Example

## Next Steps

1. Go to `/admin/teacher-payments?clearCache=true`
2. Check server console for debug logs
3. Search for "AKRAM KHALID CHECK"
4. Share the complete debug output
5. I'll help identify the specific issue based on the logs

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/salary-calculator.ts` - Added comprehensive debug logging
  - Lines 542-545: Debug teacher detection
  - Lines 155-179: Initial calculation debug
  - Lines 853-876: Akram Khalid specific check
  - Lines 995-1002: Student processing debug flags
  - Lines 1033-1407: Per-student detailed debug

## Remove Debug After Fix

Once the issue is identified and fixed, you can remove the debug logging by:

1. Remove "mubarek" and "rahmeto" from debug teacher checks
2. Remove "akram" and "khalid" from debug student checks
3. Or keep them if you want ongoing debugging for this teacher/student
