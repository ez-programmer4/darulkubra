# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Session Ending After 2 Minutes

## 🐛 **Problem Identified:**

Sessions were ending after **only 2 minutes** instead of lasting the full Zoom meeting duration (30-60+ minutes).

### **Root Cause:**

The tracking page had a `timeout_2minutes` fallback timer that was meant to prevent stuck sessions, but it was ending ALL sessions after 2 minutes, including active ones!

```javascript
// THIS WAS THE PROBLEM (NOW REMOVED):
setTimeout(() => {
  if (!isSessionEnded) {
    const currentDuration = Math.round((new Date() - sessionStartTime) / 60000);
    if (currentDuration >= 2) {
      endSession("timeout_2minutes"); // ❌ BAD - Ends active sessions!
    }
  }
}, 2 * 60 * 1000);
```

### **Evidence from Logs:**

```
💓 Heartbeat received for token: 452186E34996E3D7C64128CE054FDCE3
💓 Heartbeat updated 1 session(s) for token: 452186E34996E3D7C64128CE054FDCE3
💓 Heartbeat received for token: 452186E34996E3D7C64128CE054FDCE3
💓 Heartbeat updated 1 session(s) for token: 452186E34996E3D7C64128CE054FDCE3
🔚 Session end request for token: 452186E34996E3D7C64128CE054FDCE3, duration: 2min, reason: timeout_2minutes
✅ Session ended successfully: { duration: 2, reason: 'timeout_2minutes' }
```

**The session was:**

- ✅ Working correctly (heartbeats every 30 seconds)
- ✅ User was still in the Zoom meeting
- ❌ But got forcefully ended after 2 minutes by client-side timeout

## ✅ **Solution:**

**REMOVED ALL client-side automatic timeouts!**

Now session ending is handled by:

### **1. Server-Side Auto-Timeout** (Recommended)

- Runs via cron job every 2 hours
- Ends sessions with no heartbeats for > 2 hours
- Path: `/api/cron/session-timeout`
- This is the PRIMARY way sessions should end

### **2. Manual Page Close** (Rare)

- Only if user closes tracking page BEFORE redirecting to Zoom
- After redirect, closing tracking page does NOT end session
- Session continues via heartbeats

### **3. No Client-Side Timeouts**

- Removed 2-minute timeout
- Removed 2-hour client-side timeout
- Let server handle all automatic endings
- Client only sends heartbeats to keep session alive

## 🔄 **How Sessions Work Now:**

### **Normal Flow (60-minute meeting):**

```
Time 0:00  - Student clicks Telegram button
Time 0:05  - Redirects to Zoom (tracking page can be closed now)
Time 0:30  - Heartbeat sent ✅
Time 1:00  - Heartbeat sent ✅
Time 1:30  - Heartbeat sent ✅
Time 2:00  - Heartbeat sent ✅ (NO MORE 2-MINUTE TIMEOUT!)
Time 30:00 - Heartbeat sent ✅
Time 60:00 - Meeting ends, user leaves
Time 62:00 - Last heartbeat was 2 hours ago
Time 62:00 - Server auto-timeout ends session ✅
```

### **Database Record:**

```
clicked_at: 2025-10-12 09:00:00
session_ended_at: 2025-10-12 10:00:00
session_duration_minutes: 60  ✅ CORRECT!
session_status: timeout
last_activity_at: 2025-10-12 10:00:00
```

## 📊 **Expected Behavior:**

### **During Meeting:**

- Session status: `active`
- Heartbeats every 30 seconds
- `last_activity_at` constantly updated
- `session_ended_at`: NULL
- `session_duration_minutes`: NULL

### **After Meeting (2+ hours later):**

- Session status: `timeout`
- No more heartbeats
- `session_ended_at`: Set to last heartbeat time
- `session_duration_minutes`: Calculated (ended_at - clicked_at)

## 🚀 **Files Changed:**

### **`src/app/api/zoom/track/route.ts`**

- ❌ REMOVED: 2-minute client-side timeout
- ❌ REMOVED: 2-hour client-side timeout
- ✅ KEPT: Heartbeat mechanism (every 30 seconds)
- ✅ KEPT: Manual close before redirect
- ✅ IMPROVED: Don't end session on Zoom redirect

## 🧪 **Testing:**

### **Test 1: Short Meeting (5 minutes)**

1. Click Telegram button
2. Wait 5 seconds, redirect to Zoom
3. Stay in Zoom for 5 minutes
4. Leave Zoom
5. **Expected**: Session stays `active` for 2 hours, then auto-timeout ends it

### **Test 2: Long Meeting (60 minutes)**

1. Click Telegram button
2. Wait 5 seconds, redirect to Zoom
3. Stay in Zoom for 60 minutes
4. Leave Zoom
5. **Expected**: Session stays `active` for 2 hours, then auto-timeout ends it with 60-minute duration

### **Test 3: Manual Trigger**

1. Have some active sessions
2. Call `/api/admin/auto-timeout` (POST)
3. **Expected**: Only sessions > 2 hours old get ended

## 📝 **Important Notes:**

1. **Sessions will stay "active" after meetings end** - This is NORMAL

   - They will be cleaned up by auto-timeout after 2 hours
   - This is by design

2. **Tracking page can be closed after redirect** - Session continues

   - Heartbeats may stop if page is closed
   - Auto-timeout will handle it

3. **Use cron job for cleanup**

   - Set up Vercel cron to run `/api/cron/session-timeout` every 2 hours
   - Or manually trigger `/api/admin/auto-timeout`

4. **Duration is calculated when session ends** - Not during meeting
   - Active sessions show duration: NULL
   - Ended sessions show actual duration

## ⚙️ **Vercel Cron Setup:**

Make sure `vercel.json` has:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/session-timeout",
      "schedule": "0 */2 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

This runs every 2 hours to clean up old sessions.

## ✅ **Summary:**

**Before:**

- ❌ Sessions ended after 2 minutes
- ❌ Client-side timeouts interfered with real meetings
- ❌ Heartbeats were pointless (session ended anyway)

**After:**

- ✅ Sessions last the full meeting duration
- ✅ Only server-side auto-timeout ends sessions
- ✅ Heartbeats keep sessions alive indefinitely
- ✅ Clean up happens via cron job (every 2 hours)

**The fix is simple:** Let the server handle session endings, not the client!
