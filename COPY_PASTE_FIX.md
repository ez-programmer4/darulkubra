## 🎯 Goal

## 📋 Execute These in Order

### 1️⃣ See How Many Students Are Affected

**Copy and run this in phpMyAdmin SQL tab:**

```sql
SELECT
  ot.id,
  s.name as student,
  t.ustazname as teacher,
  DATE(ot.occupied_at) as wrong_date,
  DATE(MIN(zl.sent_time)) as correct_date,
  DATEDIFF(ot.occupied_at, MIN(zl.sent_time)) as days_lost,
  COUNT(zl.id) as zoom_links
FROM wpos_ustaz_occupied_times ot
JOIN wpos_wpdatatable_23 s ON s.wdt_ID = ot.student_id
LEFT JOIN wpos_wpdatatable_24 t ON t.ustazid = ot.ustaz_id
LEFT JOIN wpos_zoom_links zl ON zl.studentid = ot.student_id
  AND zl.ustazid = ot.ustaz_id
  AND zl.sent_time >= '2025-10-01'
WHERE ot.end_at IS NULL
GROUP BY ot.id, s.name, t.ustazname, ot.occupied_at
HAVING MIN(zl.sent_time) < ot.occupied_at
ORDER BY days_lost DESC;
```

**What you'll see:**

- List of students with wrong assignment dates
- How many days each student is losing
- Which teachers are affected

---

### 2️⃣ Fix ALL Students at Once

**Copy and run this (RECOMMENDED - most accurate):**

```sql
UPDATE wpos_ustaz_occupied_times ot
JOIN (
  SELECT
    studentid,
    ustazid,
    MIN(sent_time) as earliest_date
  FROM wpos_zoom_links
  WHERE sent_time >= '2025-10-01'
    AND sent_time <= '2025-10-31'
  GROUP BY studentid, ustazid
) first_zoom ON first_zoom.studentid = ot.student_id
  AND first_zoom.ustazid = ot.ustaz_id
SET ot.occupied_at = first_zoom.earliest_date
WHERE ot.end_at IS NULL
  AND first_zoom.earliest_date < ot.occupied_at;
```

**What this does:**

- Finds each student's first zoom link date
- Updates occupied_at to that date
- Only affects students with wrong dates

---

### 3️⃣ Verify the Fix Worked

**Copy and run this:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as problems_remaining
FROM (
  SELECT ot.id
  FROM wpos_ustaz_occupied_times ot
  LEFT JOIN wpos_zoom_links zl ON zl.studentid = ot.student_id
    AND zl.ustazid = ot.ustaz_id
    AND zl.sent_time >= '2025-10-01'
  WHERE ot.end_at IS NULL
  GROUP BY ot.id, ot.occupied_at
  HAVING MIN(zl.sent_time) < ot.occupied_at
) as check_result;
```

**Expected result:** `0` (zero problems remaining)

---

### 4️⃣ Clear Cache

**Open this URL in your browser:**

```
https://yoursite.com/api/admin/teacher-payments?clearCache=true
```

Replace `yoursite.com` with your actual domain.

---

### 5️⃣ Check Results

1. Go to **Admin Panel → Teacher Payments**
2. Select **October 2025**
3. Find **SULTAN HASSEN**
4. Expand to see students
5. **Verify Abdulbasit Meki shows:**
   - Days Worked: **9**
   - Total Earned: **(daily rate × 9) ETB**

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Simple Fix (If Above Doesn't Work)

If the join query doesn't work in your database, use this simpler version:

```sql
-- Set all active October assignments to Oct 1
UPDATE wpos_ustaz_occupied_times
SET occupied_at = '2025-10-01 00:00:00'
WHERE end_at IS NULL
  AND occupied_at > '2025-10-01 00:00:00'
  AND occupied_at <= '2025-10-31 23:59:59';
```

**This is less precise but will fix the problem.**

## ✅ Success Checklist

After running the queries:

- [ ] Query 1 showed affected students
- [ ] Query 2 (UPDATE) ran successfully
- [ ] Query 3 shows 0 problems remaining
- [ ] Cache cleared
- [ ] Teacher payment page shows all students correctly
- [ ] Abdulbasit Meki appears in SULTAN HASSEN's breakdown
- [ ] Days worked match zoom links sent

---

## 📞 If Query 2 Doesn't Work

Your database might use different SQL syntax. Try this version:

```sql
-- For each affected student, update one by one
-- First, get the list:
SELECT
  CONCAT('UPDATE wpos_ustaz_occupied_times SET occupied_at = ''',
    DATE(MIN(zl.sent_time)),
    ' 00:00:00'' WHERE id = ',
    ot.id, ';') as update_query
FROM wpos_ustaz_occupied_times ot
LEFT JOIN wpos_zoom_links zl ON zl.studentid = ot.student_id
  AND zl.ustazid = ot.ustaz_id
  AND zl.sent_time >= '2025-10-01'
WHERE ot.end_at IS NULL
GROUP BY ot.id, ot.occupied_at
HAVING MIN(zl.sent_time) < ot.occupied_at;
```

**This generates individual UPDATE statements you can copy and run.**

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**Problem:** Time slot edits changed occupied_at dates → missing students in salary
**Solution:** Reset occupied_at to first zoom link date
**Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Risk:** Low (only updating dates, not deleting data)
**Impact:** HIGH (fixes all teacher payments)
