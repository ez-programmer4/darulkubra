# ‚úÖ Time Slot Update Fix - Complete Solution

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Issue:** When updating a student's time slot (e.g., changing from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM), the system was creating a NEW `occupied_times` record with `occupied_at = current date`, breaking salary calculations.

**Impact:** Teachers lost credit for all classes taught before the time slot change.

**Example:**

- Oct 1: Student assigned, 9 zoom links sent (Oct 1-20)
- Oct 20: Time slot updated from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM
- Result: `occupied_at` changed to Oct 20 ‚ùå
- Salary calculator only counted zoom links from Oct 20 onward (1 link instead of 9!)

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Modified File: `src/app/api/registrations/route.ts`

**Before:** DELETE old + CREATE new `occupied_times` for ANY change
**After:**

- ‚úÖ **Teacher change:** DELETE old + CREATE new with new `occupied_at` (correct)
- ‚úÖ **Time slot/day package change:** UPDATE existing record (preserve `occupied_at`)

---

## üîß How It Works Now

### Case 1: Teacher Change (Correct Behavior)

```typescript
// Teacher changes from Teacher A to Teacher B
if (hasTeacherChanged) {
  // 1. Record old teacher's work in history
  // 2. Delete old occupied_times
  // 3. Create NEW occupied_times with current date ‚úÖ
  // 4. Record new teacher assignment in history
}
```

**Example:**

```
Oct 1: Student assigned to Teacher A
Oct 15: Teacher changed to Teacher B
Result:
  - Teacher A: occupied_at = Oct 1, end_at = Oct 15
  - Teacher B: occupied_at = Oct 15, end_at = NULL
  ‚úÖ Correct! Each teacher gets credit for their period
```

---

### Case 2: Time Slot Change (Now Fixed!)

```typescript
// Only time slot or day package changed, same teacher
else if (hasTimeChanged || hasDayPackageChanged) {
  // UPDATE existing record (PRESERVE occupied_at) ‚úÖ
  await tx.wpos_ustaz_occupied_times.update({
    where: { id: currentOccupiedTime.id },
    data: {
      time_slot: newTimeSlot,
      daypackage: newDayPackage,
      // DO NOT update occupied_at!
    },
  });
}
```

**Example:**

```
Oct 1: Student assigned at 8:00 AM, 9 zoom links sent (Oct 1-20)
Oct 20: Time slot updated to 9:00 AM
Result:
  - occupied_at: Oct 1 (preserved!) ‚úÖ
  - time_slot: 09:00:00 (updated)
  - All 9 zoom links still counted ‚úÖ
```

## üîß Immediate Fix for Existing Data

### Fix Abdulbasit Meki (Student ID: 11508)

Run this SQL:

```sql
-- Update occupied_at to match first zoom link date
UPDATE wpos_ustaz_occupied_times
SET occupied_at = '2025-10-01 00:00:00'
WHERE id = 8120;
```

Then clear cache:

```
/api/admin/teacher-payments?clearCache=true
```

---

## üìã Find All Affected Students

Run this SQL to find other students with the same issue:

```sql
-- Find students where occupied_at is AFTER their first zoom link
SELECT
  ot.id,
  ot.student_id,
  s.name as student_name,
  s.ustaz as teacher_id,
  t.ustazname as teacher_name,
  ot.occupied_at as assignment_date,
  MIN(zl.sent_time) as first_zoom_link,
  COUNT(zl.id) as total_zoom_links,
  DATEDIFF(DAY, MIN(zl.sent_time), ot.occupied_at) as days_lost
FROM wpos_ustaz_occupied_times ot
JOIN wpos_wpdatatable_23 s ON s.wdt_ID = ot.student_id
LEFT JOIN wpos_wpdatatable_24 t ON t.ustazid = s.ustaz
LEFT JOIN wpos_zoom_links zl ON zl.studentid = ot.student_id AND zl.ustazid = ot.ustaz_id
WHERE ot.end_at IS NULL  -- Active assignments only
GROUP BY ot.id, ot.student_id, s.name, s.ustaz, t.ustazname, ot.occupied_at
HAVING MIN(zl.sent_time) < ot.occupied_at  -- Zoom links sent BEFORE assignment date
ORDER BY days_lost DESC;
```

### Fix All Affected Students

```sql
-- Update occupied_at to match first zoom link for each student
UPDATE ot
SET occupied_at = (
  SELECT MIN(sent_time)
  FROM wpos_zoom_links
  WHERE studentid = ot.student_id
  AND ustazid = ot.ustaz_id
)
FROM wpos_ustaz_occupied_times ot
WHERE ot.end_at IS NULL
AND EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM wpos_zoom_links zl
  WHERE zl.studentid = ot.student_id
  AND zl.ustazid = ot.ustaz_id
  AND zl.sent_time < ot.occupied_at
);
```

## üîç How to Verify the Fix

### Test Case 1: Time Slot Update (No Teacher Change)

1. Create student assigned to Teacher A at 8:00 AM
2. Send 5 zoom links
3. Update time slot to 9:00 AM
4. Check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT occupied_at, time_slot
   FROM wpos_ustaz_occupied_times
   WHERE student_id = [student_id];
   ```
