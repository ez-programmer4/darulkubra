# Deduction Calculation Synchronization Fix

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Overview

Fixed critical inconsistencies between teacher payment deduction calculations and deduction adjustment preview calculations to ensure both systems use identical logic.

---

## 🚨 Problems Identified

### Problem 1: Lateness Calculation Mismatch

**Salary Calculator (WRONG - Before Fix)**

```typescript
// Line 1283: Only processed FIRST zoom link of each day
const firstLink = dayLinks[0];
// Result: Only ONE student processed per day
// Missing: All other students' lateness deductions
```

**Preview API (CORRECT)**

```typescript
// Lines 297-306: Groups by student, takes earliest link per student
const studentLinks = new Map<number, any>();
links.forEach((link: any) => {
  const key = link.studentId;
  if (
    !studentLinks.has(key) ||
    link.sent_time < studentLinks.get(key).sent_time
  ) {
    studentLinks.set(key, link);
  }
});
// Result: ALL students processed individually
```

**Impact**: Teacher payments showed FEWER lateness deductions than actually existed

---

### Problem 2: Absence Calculation Mismatch

**Preview API (WRONG - Before Fix)**

```typescript
// Lines 152-177: Checked if ANY zoom link sent, then deducted for ALL students
const dayHasZoomLinks = currentStudents.some(student => ...);
if (!dayHasZoomLinks && currentStudents.length > 0) {
  // Deducted for ALL students regardless of schedule
  for (const student of currentStudents) {
    dailyDeduction += packageRate; // WRONG - doesn't check daypackage
  }
}
```

**Salary Calculator (CORRECT)**

```typescript
// Lines 1738-1869: Checks EACH student individually
for (const student of students) {
  // 1. Check if student is scheduled on this day (daypackage)
  const scheduledDays = parseDaypackage(ot.daypackage);
  if (scheduledDays.includes(dayOfWeek)) {
    isScheduled = true;
  }

  // 2. Check if zoom link sent for THIS student
  const hasZoomLink = student.zoom_links?.some(...);

  // 3. Only deduct if scheduled but no zoom link
  if (isScheduled && !hasZoomLink) {
    dailyDeduction += packageRate;
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Preview showed INCORRECT absence deductions (too high or too low)

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Lateness Calculation in Salary Calculator

**File**: `src/lib/salary-calculator.ts`  
**Lines**: 1267-1427

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Group by Student First

```typescript
// NEW: Group by student and take earliest link per student per day
const studentLinks = new Map<number, any>();
dayLinks.forEach((link) => {
  const student = link.wpos_wpdatatable_23;
  if (!student) return;

  const studentId = student.wdt_ID;
  if (
    !studentLinks.has(studentId) ||
    link.sent_time < studentLinks.get(studentId).sent_time
  ) {
    studentLinks.set(studentId, {
      ...link,
      student: student,
    });
  }
});
```

#### B. Process All Students

```typescript
// Calculate lateness for each student's earliest link
for (const linkData of studentLinks.values()) {
  const student = linkData.student;
  // ... calculate lateness for THIS student
  // ... apply deduction
}
```

#### C. Improved Time Parsing

```typescript
// Use proper 24-hour conversion (same as preview API)
const convertTo24Hour = (timeStr: string): string => {
  if (timeStr.includes("AM") || timeStr.includes("PM")) {
    const match = timeStr.match(/^(\d{1,2}):(\d{2})\s?(AM|PM)$/i);
    if (match) {
      let hour = parseInt(match[1]);
      const minute = match[2];
      const period = match[3].toUpperCase();

      if (period === "PM" && hour !== 12) hour += 12;
      if (period === "AM" && hour === 12) hour = 0;

      return `${hour.toString().padStart(2, "0")}:${minute}`;
    }
  }
  return timeStr.includes(":")
    ? timeStr.split(":").slice(0, 2).join(":")
    : "00:00";
};
```

**Result**: ✅ Now processes ALL students' lateness, matches preview API exactly

---

### Fix 2: Absence Calculation in Preview API & Main Route

**Files**:

- `src/app/api/admin/deduction-adjustments/preview/route.ts` (Lines 123-289)
- `src/app/api/admin/deduction-adjustments/route.ts` (Lines 190-311)

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Added Daypackage Parser

```typescript
const parseDaypackage = (dp: string): number[] => {
  if (!dp || dp.trim() === "") return [];

  const dpTrimmed = dp.trim().toUpperCase();

  // Handle common patterns
  if (dpTrimmed === "ALL DAYS" || dpTrimmed === "ALLDAYS")
    return [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  if (dpTrimmed === "MWF") return [1, 3, 5];
  if (dpTrimmed === "TTS" || dpTrimmed === "TTH") return [2, 4, 6];

  // Handle individual days
  const dayMap: Record<string, number> = {
    MONDAY: 1,
    MON: 1,
    TUESDAY: 2,
    TUE: 2,
    WEDNESDAY: 3,
    WED: 3,
    THURSDAY: 4,
    THU: 4,
    FRIDAY: 5,
    FRI: 5,
    SATURDAY: 6,
    SAT: 6,
    SUNDAY: 0,
    SUN: 0,
  };

  if (dayMap[dpTrimmed] !== undefined) return [dayMap[dpTrimmed]];

  return [];
};
```

#### B. Fetch Students with Occupied Times

```typescript
// Get students with their occupied times for proper daypackage checking
const studentsWithOccupiedTimes = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: { ustaz: teacherId, status: { in: ["active", "Active"] } },
  include: {
    occupiedTimes: {
      where: {
        ustaz_id: teacherId,
        occupied_at: { lte: endDate },
        OR: [{ end_at: null }, { end_at: { gte: startDate } }],
      },
      select: {
        time_slot: true,
        daypackage: true,
        occupied_at: true,
        end_at: true,
      },
    },
    zoom_links: {
      where: {
        ustazid: teacherId,
        sent_time: { gte: startDate, lte: endDate },
      },
      select: { sent_time: true },
    },
  },
});
```

#### C. Per-Student Schedule Checking

```typescript
for (const student of studentsWithOccupiedTimes) {
  // 1. Get relevant occupied times for this date
  const relevantOccupiedTimes = student.occupiedTimes.filter((ot: any) => {
    const assignmentStart = ot.occupied_at ? new Date(ot.occupied_at) : null;
    const assignmentEnd = ot.end_at ? new Date(ot.end_at) : null;

    if (assignmentStart && d < assignmentStart) return false;
    if (assignmentEnd && d > assignmentEnd) return false;
    return true;
  });

  if (relevantOccupiedTimes.length === 0) continue;

  // 2. Check if student is scheduled on this day of week
  let isScheduled = false;
  for (const ot of relevantOccupiedTimes) {
    const scheduledDays = parseDaypackage(ot.daypackage || "");
    if (scheduledDays.includes(dayOfWeek)) {
      isScheduled = true;
      break;
    }
    // Fallback: if no daypackage but has zoom links, assume weekdays
    if (
      scheduledDays.length === 0 &&
      student.zoom_links?.length > 0 &&
      dayOfWeek >= 1 &&
      dayOfWeek <= 5
    ) {
      isScheduled = true;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (!isScheduled) continue;

  // 3. Check if student has zoom link for this date
  const hasZoomLink = student.zoom_links?.some((link: any) => {
    if (!link.sent_time) return false;
    const linkDate = format(new Date(link.sent_time), "yyyy-MM-dd");
    return linkDate === dateStr;
  });

  // 4. If scheduled but no zoom link = absence deduction
  if (!hasZoomLink) {
    const packageRate = student.package
      ? packageDeductionMap[student.package]?.absence || 25
      : 25;
    dailyDeduction += packageRate;
    affectedStudents.push({
      name: student.name,
      package: student.package || "Unknown",
      rate: packageRate,
    });
  }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ Now checks per-student schedules, matches salary calculator exactly

## 🔑 Key Changes Summary

### Lateness Calculation (Salary Calculator)

- ✅ Changed from processing ONE student per day → ALL students per day
- ✅ Groups by student first, then calculates per student
- ✅ Uses proper 24-hour time conversion
- ✅ Checks waivers before calculating
- ✅ Considers teacher changes

### Absence Calculation (Preview & Main Route)

- ✅ Changed from checking "any zoom link exists" → per-student checking
- ✅ Parses daypackage to determine scheduled days
- ✅ Only deducts if student is scheduled AND no zoom link
- ✅ Includes occupied_times data for accurate schedule checking
- ✅ Handles fallback for missing daypackages

---

## 🎯 Unified Logic

Both systems now use **IDENTICAL** calculation logic:

### Lateness:

1. Group zoom links by date
2. Group by student, take earliest link per student
3. Calculate lateness for EACH student individually
4. Check if exceeds excused threshold
5. Apply tier-based percentage
6. Skip if waived
7. Consider teacher changes

### Absence:

1. Loop through each day in period
2. For EACH student:
   - Check if assigned on this date (considering teacher changes)
   - Parse daypackage to get scheduled days
   - Check if scheduled on this day of week
   - Check if zoom link sent for this student
   - Apply deduction ONLY if scheduled but no zoom link
3. Skip Sundays based on configuration
4. Skip waived dates
5. Skip permitted dates

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Lateness Calculation Algorithm (Now Unified)

```
1. Fetch all zoom links for teacher in period
2. Group zoom links by date
3. For each date:
   a. Check if date has waiver → skip if yes
   b. Group zoom links by student
   c. For each student, take earliest zoom link
   d. For each student's earliest link:
      - Check teacher assignment (considering changes)
      - Get scheduled time slot
      - Calculate lateness in minutes
      - Skip if early or within threshold
      - Find matching tier
      - Apply percentage-based deduction
      - Add to breakdown
4. Return total deduction and detailed breakdown
```

### Absence Calculation Algorithm (Now Unified)

```
1. Fetch all students with occupied_times and zoom_links
2. For each day in period:
   a. Skip Sundays if not included
   b. Skip if has database absence record
   c. Skip if waived
   d. Skip if permitted
   e. For each student:
      - Get relevant occupied_times for this date
      - Parse daypackage to get scheduled days
      - Check if scheduled on this day of week
      - Check if zoom link sent for this student on this date
      - If scheduled AND no zoom link:
        * Get package deduction rate
        * Add to daily deduction
        * Add to affected students list
   f. If daily deduction > 0, add to records
3. Return total deduction and detailed breakdown
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Why the Mismatch Occurred

1. **Independent Development**: Two systems developed separately
2. **Different Assumptions**: Preview assumed "no links = absent for all", Salary calculator checked per-student
3. **Missing Validation**: No automated tests comparing both systems
4. **Complex Logic**: Schedule parsing is nuanced and easy to get wrong

### Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Consider extracting deduction logic to shared utility
2. **Automated Tests**: Create tests that verify both systems match
3. **Documentation**: Keep calculation logic well-documented
4. **Code Reviews**: Compare logic across systems during reviews

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements:

1. **Shared Deduction Library**

   ```typescript
   // Create: src/lib/deduction-calculator.ts
   export class DeductionCalculator {
     async calculateLatenessDeductions(...)
     async calculateAbsenceDeductions(...)
   }
   // Use in BOTH salary calculator AND preview API
   ```

2. **Validation Endpoint**

   ```typescript
   GET /api/admin/validate-deductions?teacherId=X&month=Y
   // Compares salary calculator vs preview
   // Returns discrepancies if any
   ```

3. **Unit Tests**
   ```typescript
   describe('Deduction Calculations', () => {
     it('should match between salary calculator and preview', async () => {
       const salaryResult = await calculator.calculateDeductions(...);
       const previewResult = await previewAPI.calculateDeductions(...);
       expect(salaryResult).toEqual(previewResult);
     });
   });
   ```
