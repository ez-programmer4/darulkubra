# Absence Deduction - Complete Fix

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Issues Identified from User Data

### Comparing Teacher Payment vs Deduction Adjustment:

**Teacher Payment (Correct) ✅:**

- 14 absence records
- Students: Fetya taju, Halima faris, hikma, (H)Teyba, maida hussen, Sofiya Sherefa, Sofiya Bedru
- **hikma**: 4 absences (10/8, 10/9, 10/10, 10/11)
- **maida hussen**: 2 absences (10/10, 10/13)
- Total: 356 ETB

**Deduction Adjustment (Missing Students) ❌:**

- Only 11 absence records
- **Missing hikma entirely** (4 absences)
- **Missing maida hussen on 10/10** (1 absence)
- Total: ~300 ETB (missing ~56 ETB)

**Conclusion**: Deduction Adjustment was missing ~25% of absence records!

---

## Root Causes Found

### Cause 1: Student Query Missing Teacher Changes ❌

**WRONG (Old Deduction Adjustment):**

```typescript
const studentsWithOccupiedTimes = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: { ustaz: teacherId, status: { in: ["active", "Active"] } },
  // ❌ Only finds students where current ustaz field matches
  // ❌ Misses students who had teacher changes
});
```

**CORRECT (Teacher Payment & Fixed):**

```typescript
const students = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      // Current assignment
      {
        ustaz: teacherId,
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] },
      },
      // Historical assignment (catches teacher changes)
      {
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] },
        occupiedTimes: {
          some: {
            ustaz_id: teacherId,
            occupied_at: { lte: endDate },
            OR: [{ end_at: null }, { end_at: { gte: startDate } }],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **hikma** likely had a teacher change during October
- Current `ustaz` field ≠ this teacher anymore
- But `occupiedTimes.ustaz_id` still has historical record
- Using `OR` catches both current AND historical assignments ✅

---

### Cause 2: Missing Attendance Permission Check ❌

**WRONG (Before):**

```typescript
// Check if student has zoom link
const hasZoomLink = student.zoom_links?.some(...);

// If no zoom link = absence ❌
if (!hasZoomLink) {
  dailyDeduction += packageRate; // ❌ Deducts even if student has permission!
}
```

**CORRECT (After):**

```typescript
// Check if student has zoom link
const hasZoomLink = student.zoom_links?.some(...);
if (hasZoomLink) continue;

// Check if student has attendance permission ✅
const attendanceRecord = student.attendance_progress?.find(...);
if (attendanceRecord?.attendance_status === "Permission") {
  continue; // ✅ Skip deduction if student has permission
}

// If no zoom link AND no permission = absence
dailyDeduction += packageRate;
```

**Why This Matters:**

- Teachers can request permission for students (sick leave, etc.)
- System should NOT deduct if permission was granted
- Salary calculator checks this, but deduction adjustment didn't
- Now all systems check permissions consistently ✅

---

### Cause 3: Missing "Not yet" Student Status ❌

**WRONG (Before):**

```typescript
where: {
  ustaz: teacherId,
  status: { in: ["active", "Active"] } // ❌ Only active students
}
```

**CORRECT (After):**

```typescript
where: {
  ustaz: teacherId,
  status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] } // ✅ Include new students
}
```

**Why This Matters:**

- "Not yet" = Students who registered but haven't started yet
- They can still have classes and zoom links
- Should be included in salary calculations and deductions
- Now all systems include them ✅

## Complete Fix Applied

### File 1: `src/app/api/admin/deduction-adjustments/preview/route.ts`

#### Change 1: Updated Student Query (Lines 135-175)

**BEFORE:**

```typescript
const studentsWithOccupiedTimes = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: { ustaz: teacherId, status: { in: ["active", "Active"] } },
  include: {
    occupiedTimes: { ... },
    zoom_links: { ... },
    // ❌ No attendance_progress
  },
});
```

**AFTER:**

```typescript
const studentsWithOccupiedTimes = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      // Current assignment
      {
        ustaz: teacherId,
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] } // ✅ Added "Not yet"
      },
      // Historical assignment (catches teacher changes)
      {
        occupiedTimes: {
          some: {
            ustaz_id: teacherId,
            occupied_at: { lte: endDate },
            OR: [{ end_at: null }, { end_at: { gte: startDate } }],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  include: {
    occupiedTimes: { ... },
    zoom_links: { ... },
    attendance_progress: { // ✅ Added attendance check
      where: { date: { gte: startDate, lte: endDate } },
      select: { date: true, attendance_status: true },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Change 2: Added Permission Check (Lines 289-319)

**BEFORE:**

```typescript
const hasZoomLink = student.zoom_links?.some(...);

// If scheduled but no zoom link = absence
if (!hasZoomLink) {
  dailyDeduction += packageRate;
  affectedStudents.push(...);
}
```

**AFTER:**

```typescript
const hasZoomLink = student.zoom_links?.some(...);
if (hasZoomLink) continue;

// ✅ Check if student has attendance permission
const attendanceRecord = student.attendance_progress?.find(
  (att: any) => {
    const attDate = format(new Date(att.date), "yyyy-MM-dd");
    return attDate === dateStr;
  }
);

if (attendanceRecord?.attendance_status === "Permission") {
  continue; // ✅ Skip deduction if student has permission
}

// If scheduled but no zoom link and no permission = absence
dailyDeduction += packageRate;
affectedStudents.push(...);
```

---

### File 2: `src/app/api/admin/deduction-adjustments/route.ts`

#### Change 1: Updated Student Query (Lines 125-173)

**Applied same OR query and attendance_progress inclusion as preview route**

#### Change 2: Added Permission Check (Lines 321-354)

**Applied same permission checking logic as preview route**

---

### File 3: `src/lib/salary-calculator.ts`

#### Change: Added Status Filter (Lines 1526-1553)

**BEFORE:**

```typescript
const students = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { ustaz: teacherId, occupiedTimes: { some: { ... } } },
      { occupiedTimes: { some: { ... } } },
    ],
  },
  // ❌ No status filter
});
```

**AFTER:**

```typescript
const students = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      {
        ustaz: teacherId,
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] }, // ✅ Added
        occupiedTimes: { some: { ... } },
      },
      {
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] }, // ✅ Added
        occupiedTimes: { some: { ... } },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### For Teacher: (H)FEDILA DIMA, October 2025

**Deduction Adjustment Should Now Show (Same as Teacher Payment):**

| Date  | Student        | Package     | Reason       | Deduction |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------------- |
| 10/2  | Fetya taju     | 5 days      | No zoom link | 30 ETB    |
| 10/4  | Halima faris   | 5 days      | No zoom link | 30 ETB    |
| 10/8  | hikma          | 5 days      | No zoom link | 30 ETB    | ← **Now included!** |
| 10/9  | (H)Teyba       | Hifz 3 days | No zoom link | 13 ETB    |
| 10/9  | hikma          | 5 days      | No zoom link | 30 ETB    | ← **Now included!** |
| 10/10 | Halima faris   | 5 days      | No zoom link | 30 ETB    |
| 10/10 | hikma          | 5 days      | No zoom link | 30 ETB    | ← **Now included!** |

| 10/13 | Sofiya Bedru   | 3 days      | No zoom link | 17 ETB    |

**Total: 14 records, 356 ETB** (was 11, now matches Teacher Payment!)

---

## How to Verify the Fix

### Step 1: Test Teacher Payment (Baseline)

1. **Go to**: `/admin/teacher-payments?month=10&year=2025&clearCache=true`
2. **Select teacher**: (H)FEDILA DIMA
3. **Check absence section**:
   - Count records (should be 14)
   - Note students shown
   - Check total (should be 356 ETB)

### Step 2: Test Deduction Adjustment (Should Match Now)

1. **Go to**: `/admin/deduction-adjustments`
2. **Select same teacher**: (H)FEDILA DIMA
3. **Date range**: 2025-10-01 to 2025-10-31
4. **Choose**: "Waive Absence Deductions"
5. **Click**: "Preview"
6. **Verify**:
   - Record count: 14 (not 11) ✅
   - Students include: hikma (4 times), maida hussen (2 times) ✅
   - Total amount: 356 ETB ✅

### Step 3: Verify Permission Handling

**Test Case**: If a student has permission on a day with no zoom link

1. **Grant permission** to a student for a specific date
2. **Verify Teacher Payment**: Should NOT show absence deduction for that date
3. **Verify Deduction Adjustment**: Should also NOT show absence for that date
4. **Result**: Both should match ✅

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:

1. ✅ `src/app/api/admin/deduction-adjustments/preview/route.ts`

   - Lines 135-184: Updated student query with OR logic and status filter
   - Lines 174-182: Added attendance_progress to include
   - Lines 289-319: Added permission check before deduction

2. ✅ `src/app/api/admin/deduction-adjustments/route.ts`

   - Lines 125-173: Updated student query with OR logic and status filter
   - Lines 163-171: Added attendance_progress to include
   - Lines 321-354: Added permission check before deduction

3. ✅ `src/lib/salary-calculator.ts`
   - Lines 1526-1553: Added status filter to student query

---

## Why This Happened

### Original Logic Flaws:

1. **Too Narrow Query**:

   ```typescript
   where: {
     ustaz: teacherId;
   } // Only current assignments
   ```

   **Problem**: Misses students who had teacher changes

2. **Missing Permission Check**:

   ```typescript
   if (!hasZoomLink) {
     deduct();
   } // Deducts even with permission
   ```

   **Problem**: Deducts even when student has valid excuse

3. **Missing Status Values**:
   ```typescript
   status: { in: ["active", "Active"] } // Only active
   ```
   **Problem**: Excludes "Not yet" students who should be counted

### Better Approach:

1. **Use OR for Current + Historical**:

   ```typescript
   OR: [
     { ustaz: teacherId, status: [...] },
     { occupiedTimes: { some: { ustaz_id: teacherId } } }
   ]
   ```

2. **Check Permissions**:

   ```typescript
   if (hasPermission) continue; // Skip deduction
   ```

3. **Include All Valid Statuses**:
   ```typescript
   status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] }
   ```

**Benefits**:

- No missed students ✅
- Respects permissions ✅
- Handles all statuses ✅
- Perfect synchronization ✅

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Verify All Students Appear

**Teacher**: (H)FEDILA DIMA  
**Period**: October 2025

**Expected Students in Absence Records:**

1. ✅ Fetya taju (2 absences)
2. ✅ Halima faris (3 absences)
3. ✅ hikma (4 absences) ← **Critical test**
4. ✅ (H)Teyba (2 absences)
5. ✅ maida hussen (2 absences) ← **Critical test**
6. ✅ Sofiya Sherefa (1 absence)
7. ✅ Sofiya Bedru (1 absence)

**Steps:**

1. Go to teacher payments
2. Select teacher
3. Check absence breakdown
4. Verify ALL 7 students appear
5. Go to deduction adjustments
6. Preview absence waivers
7. Verify same 7 students appear

---

### Test Case 2: Verify Absence Counts

**Check these specific students:**

| Student      | Expected Absences            | Teacher Payment | Deduction Adj |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| hikma        | 4 (10/8, 10/9, 10/10, 10/11) | Should show 4   | Should show 4 |
| maida hussen | 2 (10/10, 10/13)             | Should show 2   | Should show 2 |
| Halima faris | 3 (10/4, 10/10, 10/11)       | Should show 3   | Should show 3 |

**All should match!** ✅

---

### Test Case 3: Verify Permission Handling

**Scenario**: Student has permission on absence day

1. **Create permission**:

   - Student: hikma
   - Date: 2025-10-08
   - Status: "Permission"

2. **Check Teacher Payment**:

   - hikma should have 3 absences (not 4)
   - 10/8 should NOT be counted

3. **Check Deduction Adjustment**:

   - hikma should also have 3 absences (not 4)
   - 10/8 should NOT appear in preview

4. **Result**: Both should match ✅

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Students Still Missing:

1. **Check Database**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     s.wdt_ID,
     s.name,
     s.ustaz AS current_ustaz,
     s.status,
     COUNT(DISTINCT ot.id) as assignment_count
   FROM wpos_wpdatatable_23 s
   LEFT JOIN wpos_ustaz_occupied_times ot
     ON s.wdt_ID = ot.student_id
     AND ot.ustaz_id = '(H)FEDILA DIMA'
   WHERE s.name = 'hikma'
   GROUP BY s.wdt_ID;
   ```

   Should show:

   - Current ustaz (might be different)
   - Status (active or not yet)
   - Assignment count > 0

2. **Check Occupied Times**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     ustaz_id,
     student_id,
     occupied_at,
     end_at,
     daypackage
   FROM wpos_ustaz_occupied_times
   WHERE student_id = (SELECT wdt_ID FROM wpos_wpdatatable_23 WHERE name = 'hikma')
     AND ustaz_id = '(H)FEDILA DIMA';
   ```

   Should show assignment records for the period

3. **Check Zoom Links**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     DATE(sent_time) as date,
     COUNT(*) as link_count
   FROM wpos_zoom_links
   WHERE studentid = (SELECT wdt_ID FROM wpos_wpdatatable_23 WHERE name = 'hikma')
     AND ustazid = '(H)FEDILA DIMA'
     AND sent_time BETWEEN '2025-10-01' AND '2025-10-31'
   GROUP BY DATE(sent_time)
   ORDER BY date;
   ```

   Should show dates WITH zoom links (absence = dates WITHOUT links)

---

### If Permission Check Fails:

1. **Verify attendance_progress table**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     s.name,
     ap.date,
     ap.attendance_status
   FROM wpos_attendance_progress ap
   JOIN wpos_wpdatatable_23 s ON s.wdt_ID = ap.student_id
   WHERE s.name = 'hikma'
     AND ap.date BETWEEN '2025-10-01' AND '2025-10-31'
   ORDER BY ap.date;
   ```

2. **Check API includes attendance_progress**:

   - Should see `attendance_progress` in student query
   - Should have `where: { date: { gte: startDate, lte: endDate } }`

3. **Check permission check logic**:
   - Should check `attendance_status === "Permission"`
   - Should `continue` (skip) if permission found

---
