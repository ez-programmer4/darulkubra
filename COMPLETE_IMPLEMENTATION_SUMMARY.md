## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Durations showing as "-"

**Cause:** Old meetings created before enhancement  
**Solution:** Only new meetings (after today) will show participant durations

### Issue: Teacher duration = 0

**Cause:** Teacher hasn't left meeting yet (still active)  
**Solution:** Duration calculated when teacher leaves

### Issue: Student duration missing

**Cause:** Student never joined OR hasn't left yet  
**Solution:** Wait for meeting to end

### Issue: CSV export empty

**Cause:** No meetings in selected month  
**Solution:** Change month selector

## What's Automatic

✅ Meeting creation via Zoom OAuth  
✅ Link delivery to student (when teacher starts)  
✅ Duration tracking (both participants)  
✅ Join/leave timestamp recording  
✅ Status updates  
✅ Calculations (durations, percentages)
