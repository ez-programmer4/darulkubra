# Teacher Salary Synchronization - Complete Fix

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Issue Reported

**User**: "the teacher-payment in admin the absence deduction is the same but in teacher/salary it is not the same lateness and base salary"

**Translation**:

- ✅ Absence deductions match between admin and teacher views
- ❌ **Lateness deductions DO NOT match**
- ❌ **Base salary DOES NOT match**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

Even though both admin and teacher views use the **same `SalaryCalculator` class**, they were showing **different results**. Why?

### The Problem: Student Fetching Queries Were Inconsistent

The `SalaryCalculator` has **multiple methods** that fetch students:

1. **`getTeacherStudents()`** - Used for base salary ❌ (WRONG QUERY)
2. **`calculateLatenessDeductions()`** - Fetches students again ❌ (WRONG QUERY)
3. **`calculateAbsenceDeductions()`** - Fetches students again ✅ (CORRECT QUERY - fixed earlier)

**The Problem**: Methods 1 and 2 used **simple queries** that:

- ❌ Didn't filter by status ("active", "Not yet")
- ❌ Didn't use OR logic to catch teacher changes
- ❌ Only looked at `ustaz: teacherId` (current assignment)
- ❌ Missed students who had teacher changes

---

## Detailed Issues Found

### Issue 1: `getTeacherStudents()` Query ❌

**Location**: `src/lib/salary-calculator.ts` line 522

**BEFORE (WRONG):**

```typescript
const currentStudents = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    ustaz: teacherId,
    occupiedTimes: {
      some: {
        ustaz_id: teacherId,
        occupied_at: { lte: toDate },
        OR: [{ end_at: null }, { end_at: { gte: fromDate } }],
      },
    },
  },
  // ❌ No status filter
  // ❌ Only current ustaz field
  // ❌ Misses students with teacher changes
});
```

**AFTER (CORRECT):**

```typescript
const currentStudents = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      // Current assignment (active or not yet)
      {
        ustaz: teacherId,
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] }, // ✅ Added
        occupiedTimes: {
          some: {
            ustaz_id: teacherId,
            occupied_at: { lte: toDate },
            OR: [{ end_at: null }, { end_at: { gte: fromDate } }],
          },
        },
      },
      // Historical assignment via occupiedTimes (catches teacher changes) ✅
      {
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] }, // ✅ Added
        occupiedTimes: {
          some: {
            ustaz_id: teacherId,
            occupied_at: { lte: toDate },
            OR: [{ end_at: null }, { end_at: { gte: fromDate } }],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

**Impact**: This query feeds into `calculateBaseSalary()`, so **base salary was wrong** ❌

---

### Issue 2: Historical Students Query ❌

**Location**: `src/lib/salary-calculator.ts` line 598

**BEFORE (WRONG):**

```typescript
const historicalStudents = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    wdt_ID: { in: Array.from(historicalStudentIds) },
    // ❌ No status filter
  },
});
```

**AFTER (CORRECT):**

```typescript
const historicalStudents = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    wdt_ID: { in: Array.from(historicalStudentIds) },
    status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] }, // ✅ Added
  },
});
```

**Impact**: Historical students (from audit logs) weren't filtered by status ❌

---

### Issue 3: Lateness Student Query ❌

**Location**: `src/lib/salary-calculator.ts` line 1204

**BEFORE (WRONG):**

```typescript
const allStudents = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: { ustaz: teacherId }, // ❌ Simple query
  select: {
    wdt_ID: true,
    name: true,
    package: true,
    zoom_links: true,
    occupiedTimes: { select: { time_slot: true } },
  },
});
```

**AFTER (CORRECT):**

```typescript
const allStudents = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      // Current assignment (active or not yet)
      {
        ustaz: teacherId,
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] }, // ✅ Added
      },
      // Historical assignment via occupiedTimes (catches teacher changes) ✅
      {
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] }, // ✅ Added
        occupiedTimes: {
          some: {
            ustaz_id: teacherId,
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  select: {
    wdt_ID: true,
    name: true,
    package: true,
    zoom_links: true,
    occupiedTimes: { select: { time_slot: true } },
  },
});
```

**Impact**: Lateness calculation was **missing students** ❌

---

## Why Absence Deductions Were Already Correct ✅

The `calculateAbsenceDeductions()` method was **already fixed** in the previous session with the correct query:

```typescript
const students = await prisma.wpos_wpdatatable_23.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      // Current assignment
      {
        ustaz: teacherId,
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] },
        occupiedTimes: { some: { ... } },
      },
      // Historical assignment
      {
        status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] },
        occupiedTimes: { some: { ustaz_id: teacherId, ... } },
      },
    ],
  },
  include: {
    occupiedTimes: { ... },
    zoom_links: { ... },
    attendance_progress: { ... }, // ✅ Checks permissions
  },
});
```

This is why **absence deductions matched** between admin and teacher views! ✅

## Why This Fix Works

### Unified Student Fetching

**Before**: Each calculation fetched students differently ❌

- Base salary: Simple query (wrong)
- Lateness: Simple query (wrong)
- Absence: Complex OR query (correct)

**After**: All calculations use consistent queries ✅

- Base salary: OR query with status filter (correct)
- Lateness: OR query with status filter (correct)
- Absence: OR query with status filter (correct)

### Consistent Status Filtering

**Before**: Status filters were inconsistent ❌

- Some queries: No filter
- Some queries: Only "active"
- Some queries: "active" + "Not yet"

**After**: All queries consistently filter ✅

- All queries: `status: { in: ["active", "Active", "Not yet", "not yet"] }`

### Teacher Change Handling

**Before**: Only some queries used OR logic ❌

- Most queries: `ustaz: teacherId` (misses teacher changes)
- Absence query: OR logic (correct)

**After**: All queries use OR logic ✅

- All queries catch both current AND historical assignments
- No students missed due to teacher changes

**Steps**:

1. Check database: Find a student with `status = "Not yet"` who has:
   - `ustaz` assigned
   - `occupiedTimes` records
   - `zoom_links` sent
2. Admin view: Verify this student appears in breakdown
3. Teacher view: Verify this student appears in breakdown
4. **Result**: Student should appear in both views ✅

---

### Test Case 5: Verify Teacher Changes Handled

**Scenario**: Student had teacher change during period

**Steps**:

1. Check `teacher_change_history` table for changes in October
2. Find a teacher who was either old or new teacher for a student
3. Admin view: Verify student appears with correct periods
4. Teacher view: Verify student appears with correct periods
5. **Result**: Both views show the same periods and amounts ✅

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Base Salary Still Doesn't Match:

1. **Clear Cache**:

   - Admin: Add `?clearCache=true` to URL
   - Teacher: Refresh page multiple times

2. **Check Student Count**:

   ```sql
   -- Check how many students should be included
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.wdt_ID)
   FROM wpos_wpdatatable_23 s
   WHERE (
     (s.ustaz = 'TEACHER_ID' AND s.status IN ('active', 'Active', 'Not yet', 'not yet'))
     OR EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM wpos_ustaz_occupied_times ot
       WHERE ot.student_id = s.wdt_ID
         AND ot.ustaz_id = 'TEACHER_ID'
         AND s.status IN ('active', 'Active', 'Not yet', 'not yet')
     )
   );
   ```

3. **Check Package Rates**:
   ```sql
   SELECT packageName, salaryPerStudent
   FROM wpos_package_salary
   ORDER BY packageName;
   ```

---

### If Lateness Still Doesn't Match:

1. **Check Zoom Links**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     s.name,
     DATE(zl.sent_time) as date,
     COUNT(*) as links
   FROM wpos_zoom_links zl
   JOIN wpos_wpdatatable_23 s ON s.wdt_ID = zl.studentid
   WHERE zl.ustazid = 'TEACHER_ID'
     AND zl.sent_time BETWEEN '2025-10-01' AND '2025-10-31'
   GROUP BY s.name, DATE(zl.sent_time)
   ORDER BY date, s.name;
   ```

2. **Check Time Slots**:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     s.name,
     ot.time_slot
   FROM wpos_ustaz_occupied_times ot
   JOIN wpos_wpdatatable_23 s ON s.wdt_ID = ot.student_id
   WHERE ot.ustaz_id = 'TEACHER_ID'
   ORDER BY s.name;
   ```

3. **Enable Debug Mode**:
   - Edit `src/lib/salary-calculator.ts` line 116
   - Add teacher ID to `debugTeacherIds` array
   - Check console for detailed logs
