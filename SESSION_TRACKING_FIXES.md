# Session Tracking Fixes - Production Issues Resolved

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **Session Ending Too Early (12 seconds)**

**Problem:** Sessions were ending immediately when redirecting to Zoom because:

- `visibility_hidden` event fired when user opened Zoom app
- Page unload events fired during redirect
- Duration was only 12 seconds instead of actual meeting time

**Solution:**

- Added `hasRedirected` flag to track when redirect happens
- Disabled session ending on `beforeunload`, `unload`, and `pagehide` events during redirect
- Removed automatic session ending on visibility change
- Now session only ends when user manually closes the tracking page OR after 2-hour auto-timeout

### 2. **Negative Countdown Display**

**Problem:** Countdown showed negative numbers (-1, -2, -3 seconds)

**Solution:**

- Added check to stop countdown at 0
- Display "Redirecting now..." when countdown reaches 0
- Clear countdown interval when it reaches 0

### 3. **Sessions Stuck in "Active" State**

**Problem:** Some sessions remained "active" even after student left

**Solution:**

- Sessions now rely on:
  1. **Heartbeat mechanism**: Updates `last_activity_at` every 30 seconds
  2. **Auto-timeout cron job**: Ends sessions inactive for > 2 hours
  3. **Manual end on page close**: Only when user closes tracking page (not Zoom)

### 4. **Missing Duration (N/A)**

**Problem:** Some sessions showed "N/A" for duration

**Solution:**

- Duration is now calculated properly in the database
- Sessions that are still active show "N/A" until they end
- Once ended, duration is calculated: `(session_ended_at - clicked_at) / 60000` minutes

## 🔄 **How Session Tracking Now Works:**

### **Step 1: Student Clicks Telegram Button**

1. Redirects to `/api/zoom/track?token=...`
2. Database updated:
   - `clicked_at` = now
   - `session_status` = 'active'
   - `last_activity_at` = now

### **Step 2: Tracking Page Shows (5 seconds)**

1. Displays countdown: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, "Redirecting now..."
2. Sends initial heartbeat
3. After 5 seconds, redirects to Zoom
4. **IMPORTANT**: Does NOT end session on redirect

### **Step 3: Student in Zoom Meeting**

1. Heartbeat sends update every 30 seconds (updates `last_activity_at`)
2. Session remains "active" in database
3. Tracking page can be closed - session continues

### **Step 4: Session Ends**

Sessions can end in 3 ways:

**A. Student Closes Tracking Page (Before Zoom Opens)**

- If user closes tracking page before redirecting to Zoom
- Triggers: `beforeunload`, `unload`, or `pagehide` events
- Database updates:
  - `session_ended_at` = now
  - `session_duration_minutes` = calculated duration
  - `session_status` = 'ended'

**B. Auto-Timeout (Recommended)**

- After 2 hours of no heartbeats
- Cron job (`/api/cron/session-timeout`) runs every 2 hours
- Database updates same as above
- Status = 'timeout'

**C. Manual End**

- Admin can trigger `/api/admin/auto-timeout` manually
- Same behavior as auto-timeout

## 📊 **Expected Behavior:**

### **Normal Session Flow:**

```
1. Click Telegram button
2. Tracking page shows: "Redirecting in 5 seconds..."
3. Countdown: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, "Redirecting now..."
4. Opens Zoom
5. Tracking page can be closed/ignored
6. Heartbeats keep session alive
7. After meeting, session auto-times out after 2 hours
```

### **Database Records:**

**Active Session (During Meeting):**

```
clicked_at: 2025-10-12 09:00:00
session_ended_at: NULL
session_duration_minutes: NULL
session_status: active
last_activity_at: 2025-10-12 09:30:00  (updated every 30 sec)
```

**Ended Session (After Meeting):**

```
clicked_at: 2025-10-12 09:00:00
session_ended_at: 2025-10-12 10:30:00
session_duration_minutes: 90
session_status: timeout (or 'ended')
last_activity_at: 2025-10-12 10:30:00
```

## 🎯 **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Tracking Page JavaScript** (`src/app/api/zoom/track/route.ts`):

   - Added `hasRedirected` flag
   - Fixed countdown to not go negative
   - Disabled session ending during Zoom redirect
   - Removed visibility change session ending

2. **Session Duration Calculation** remains unchanged:

   - Calculated in `/api/zoom/end-session`
   - Minimum 1 minute for very short sessions

3. **Auto-Timeout** (`src/lib/session-timeout.ts`):
   - Runs every 2 hours via cron job
   - Ends sessions with no activity for > 2 hours
   - Fixed TypeScript type errors

## ✅ **Testing:**

To test the fixes:

1. **Click Telegram Button**

   - Should see countdown: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
   - Should NOT see negative numbers
   - Should redirect to Zoom after 5 seconds

2. **Check Database**

   - Session should be "active"
   - `clicked_at` should be set
   - `last_activity_at` should be set
   - `session_ended_at` should be NULL

3. **Close Tracking Page**

   - Tracking page can be closed
   - Session should remain "active"
   - Heartbeats continue if page stays open

4. **After 2+ Hours**
   - Run cron job or manual trigger
   - Session should end with "timeout" status
   - Duration should be calculated correctly

## 🚀 **Deployment:**

Changes made to:

- `src/app/api/zoom/track/route.ts` - Fixed tracking page JavaScript
- `src/lib/session-timeout.ts` - Fixed TypeScript errors
- `src/app/api/health/session-tracking/route.ts` - Fixed TypeScript errors

No database changes needed - columns already exist.

## 📝 **Notes:**

- Sessions are designed to stay "active" during meetings
- Use auto-timeout cron job to clean up old sessions
- Heartbeat mechanism keeps session alive
- Very short sessions (< 1 minute) are prevented from ending accidentally
- Tracking page can be closed after redirect - session continues
