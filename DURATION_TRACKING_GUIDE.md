## ✅ Requirements for Automatic Tracking

### To Get Automatic Duration Tracking:

   - This creates meeting via Zoom API
   - Enables automatic webhook tracking

2. ✅ Teacher must connect their Zoom account

   - One-time setup
   - Click "Connect Zoom Account" banner

3. ✅ Zoom webhooks must be configured (already done!)
   - Listens for participant join/leave events
   - Automatically records timestamps

---

## 🔴 What Doesn't Get Tracked

### Manual Zoom Links (Not Auto-Created):

If teacher creates meeting manually in Zoom and just pastes the link:

- ❌ Duration NOT tracked automatically
- ❌ No join/leave timestamps
- ⚠️ Attendance can still be marked manually

**Solution:** Always use **"Auto-Create Meeting"** feature!
