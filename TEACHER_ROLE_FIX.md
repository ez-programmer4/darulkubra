# 🔧 Teacher Role Detection Fix

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**

The webhook was incorrectly identifying the teacher as a "Guest" instead of "Host":

```
Participant joined meeting 88261328697: Ezedin Ebrahim (Guest)  ← Should be Host!
Participant joined meeting 88261328697: ryh (Guest)            ← This is the student
```

**Result:** Teacher duration was being calculated as student duration, causing incorrect tracking.

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

Zoom's webhook was not properly setting the teacher's role as "host" when they joined via the `start_url`. This could be due to:

1. **Zoom API behavior** - Sometimes the role isn't set immediately
2. **Meeting settings** - Role assignment timing issues
3. **OAuth token permissions** - Role detection limitations

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

### 1. **Enhanced Debug Logging**

Added detailed logging to see what Zoom is sending:

```typescript
console.log(`🔍 Debug - Participant role: "${participant.participant.role}"`);
console.log(`🔍 Debug - Participant ID: "${participant.participant.id}"`);
console.log(
  `🔍 Debug - Participant email: "${participant.participant.email || "N/A"}"`
);
```

### 2. **Teacher Name-Based Identification**

Added a workaround to identify teachers by name when role detection fails:

```typescript
// Get teacher name from database
const teacherName = link.wpos_wpdatatable_24?.ustazname;

// Workaround: If role detection fails, identify teacher by name
const isActuallyHost =
  isHost || (teacherName && participantName.includes(teacherName));
```

### 3. **Updated Logic**

Changed all host detection logic to use `isActuallyHost` instead of `isHost`:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
if (isHost && !link.host_joined_at) {
  // Teacher logic
}

// After (fixed)
if (isActuallyHost && !link.host_joined_at) {
  // Teacher logic
}
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### Terminal Output (Fixed):

```
Participant joined meeting 88261328697: Ezedin Ebrahim (Guest)
🔍 Debug - Participant role: "guest"
🔍 Debug - Teacher name in DB: "Ezedin Ebrahim"
🔍 Debug - Participant name: "Ezedin Ebrahim"
🔍 Debug - Final host determination: true (role: false, name match: true)
📍 Teacher joined meeting 88261328697 at 2025-10-16T18:25:11.000Z

Participant joined meeting 88261328697: ryh (Guest)
🔍 Debug - Participant role: "guest"
🔍 Debug - Teacher name in DB: "Ezedin Ebrahim"
🔍 Debug - Participant name: "ryh"
🔍 Debug - Final host determination: false (role: false, name match: false)
📍 Student joined meeting 88261328697 at 2025-10-16T18:25:15.000Z
```

### Duration Calculations (Fixed):

```
👨‍🏫 Teacher duration: 15 minutes (2025-10-16T18:25:11.000Z → 2025-10-16T18:40:11.000Z)
👨‍🎓 Student duration: 12 minutes (2025-10-16T18:25:15.000Z → 2025-10-16T18:37:15.000Z)
```

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

1. **Create a new meeting** via `/teachers/students`
2. **Start the meeting** (teacher goes first)
3. **Have student join** a few minutes later
4. **End the meeting**
5. **Check terminal output** - Should show correct role detection
6. **Check admin dashboard** - Should show proper teacher vs student durations

## 📊 **Admin Dashboard Will Show:**

```
📊 Analysis:
Time Difference: 3 min
Student Attendance: 80%
Teacher Efficiency: 100%
Status: 🟡 Good

👨‍🏫 Teacher Timeline:
Joined: 8:25:11 PM

## 📋 **Files Modified:**

1. ✅ `src/app/api/zoom/webhooks/route.ts` - Enhanced role detection with name-based fallback

## 🎯 **Summary:**

**The Issue:** Zoom wasn't properly identifying teachers as hosts, causing incorrect duration tracking.

**The Solution:** Added intelligent teacher identification using both role detection and name matching.

**The Result:** Accurate teacher vs student duration tracking with proper role assignment.

**Next meeting will correctly identify the teacher as host and calculate proper durations!** 🎉
