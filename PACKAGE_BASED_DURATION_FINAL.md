# 🔒 Package-Based Duration Tracking - Trustworthy & Tamper-Proof

## ✅ **THE SOLUTION: Use Package Duration (Can't Be Manipulated!)**

### **Key Insight:**

- Teachers are paid based on **package** (e.g., "1 Hour Europe")
- Package duration is **pre-agreed** between admin and teacher
- Use **package duration** for billing, not actual time
- **Trustworthy** - can't be manipulated by teacher or student

---

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **Simple & Automatic:**

```
1. Student clicks Telegram button
   └─ clicked_at = 09:00:00 (START)
   └─ Immediately redirect to Zoom

2. Student attends Zoom meeting
   └─ System does nothing (no tracking needed!)

3. After 90 minutes, auto-timeout runs
   └─ Finds session from 09:00
   └─ Checks package: "Europe" = 60 minutes
   └─ session_ended_at = 09:00:00 + 60 min = 10:00:00
   └─ session_duration_minutes = 60 (from package!)
   └─ session_status = 'timeout'

✅ RESULT: 60-minute duration (from package, trustworthy!)
```

## 📊 **Duration Calculation (Trustworthy):**

### **Based on Package:**

```javascript
// Extract duration from package name
const packageDurations = {
  Europe: 60, // 1 hour
  USA: 60, // 1 hour
  Canada: 60, // 1 hour
  "0 Fee": 30, // 30 minutes
  "1 Hour": 60,
  "30 Min": 30,
};

duration = packageDurations[packageId] || 60; // Default 1 hour
```

### **Examples:**

| Package         | Duration | End Time            | Calculation    |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Europe          | 60 min   | clicked_at + 60min  | Trustworthy ✅ |
| USA             | 60 min   | clicked_at + 60min  | Trustworthy ✅ |
| 0 Fee           | 30 min   | clicked_at + 30min  | Trustworthy ✅ |
| Custom "2 Hour" | 120 min  | clicked_at + 120min | Trustworthy ✅ |

---

## 🔒 **Why This Is Trustworthy:**

✅ **Based on pre-agreed package** - Admin set the package duration
✅ **Can't be manipulated** - Teacher can't change package duration
✅ **Consistent** - Same package = same duration every time
✅ **Fair** - Teachers paid for package, not inflated time
✅ **Simple** - No complex tracking needed
✅ **Automatic** - System calculates, not humans
✅ **Auditable** - All packages and durations logged

## 📝 **Database Records:**

### **When Student Clicks:**

```sql
id: 341023
studentid: 244480
ustazid: U430
packageId: Europe           ← Package determines duration!
packageRate: 33.00
clicked_at: 2025-10-12 09:00:00    ← START
session_ended_at: NULL
session_duration_minutes: NULL
session_status: active
```

### **After Auto-Timeout (90+ minutes later):**

```sql
id: 341023
studentid: 244480
ustazid: U430
packageId: Europe           ← Used to determine duration
packageRate: 33.00
clicked_at: 2025-10-12 09:00:00    ← START
session_ended_at: 2025-10-12 10:00:00  ← START + 60 min (from package)
session_duration_minutes: 60        ← From package (trustworthy!)
session_status: timeout
```

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration:**

### **Auto-Timeout:**

```javascript
// Check sessions older than 90 minutes
const ninetyMinutesAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 90 * 60 * 1000);

const oldSessions = await prisma.wpos_zoom_links.findMany({
  where: {
    session_status: "active",
    clicked_at: { lt: ninetyMinutesAgo },
  },
});

// For each old session, use package duration
for (const session of oldSessions) {
  const packageDuration = getPackageDuration(session.packageId);
  const endTime = new Date(session.clicked_at + packageDuration * 60 * 1000);

  await update({
    session_ended_at: endTime,
    session_duration_minutes: packageDuration,
    session_status: "timeout",
  });
}
```

### **Cron Schedule:**

```json
{
  "schedule": "*/30 * * * *" // Every 30 minutes
}
```

**Runs at:** 09:00, 09:30, 10:00, 10:30...

## 🎨 **Admin Dashboard Shows:**

```
Teacher: Ahmed Hassan
Student: Sara Mohamed
Package: Europe (60 min)          ← Shows package
Start: 09:00 AM
End: 10:00 AM (auto)
Duration: 60 min                   ← From package
Rate: $33
Total: $33
Status: timeout
```

**Admin can see:**

- ✅ Duration matches package
- ✅ Billing is accurate (based on package)
- ✅ No manipulation possible
- ✅ Fair for both teacher and admin

## 📋 **Package Duration Mapping:**

Add to your system:

```javascript
const PACKAGE_DURATIONS = {
  // Regional packages (typically 1 hour)
  Europe: 60,
  USA: 60,
  Canada: 60,
  UK: 60,
  Australia: 60,

  // Special packages
  "0 Fee": 30,
  "Free Trial": 30,
  "Quick Session": 30,

  // Time-based packages
  "30 Min": 30,
  "45 Min": 45,
  "1 Hour": 60,
  "90 Min": 90,
  "2 Hour": 120,

  // Default
  DEFAULT: 60,
};
```
